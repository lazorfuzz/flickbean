      <h1>Flick Bean Coffee Co.</h1>
      <p>Started in 2015, Flick Bean was built from the ground up by three inventive young lads. Our coffee is sourced from El Salvador, and roasted in our custom-built roaster.</p>
      <p>We customize every roast according to the preferences of our customers.  Your coffee won't come off a warehouse shelf. Instead, it is roasted and packaged after your order goes through.</p>
      <p>Begin by selecting a coffee bean, your preferred roast, and your quantity. Then choose whether you'd like it grinded, then whether you want it in a paper bag or a mason jar.</p>
