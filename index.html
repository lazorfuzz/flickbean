      <h1>Cool Beans California Coffee Co.</h1>
      <p>Started in 2015, Cool Beans California was built from the ground up by three inventive young lads. Our coffee is sourced from beautiful El Salvador, and roasted in our custom-built roaster.</p>
      <p>We personalize every roast according to the preferences of our customers.  Your coffee won't come off a warehouse shelf. Instead, it is freshly roasted and packaged after your order goes through.</p>
